# This rayrc is intended for use within SCAD.
# This rayrc file is suitable for use on Linux computers with mental ray.
# The file should be saved as ".rayrc" - note the leading dot - in the root
# of your user account. A .rayrc file specifies the locations of mental images
# shaders and the location of the users custom shaders (and their associated
# mi files). It is recommended the following directories be used to store
# the users files,
#    ~/mi/shader_src
#    ~/mi/shaders
#    ~/mi/scenes
