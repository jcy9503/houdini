<P>
To enable Maya to receive Mel scripts from Cutter open the script window<BR>
and enter this mel command.<BR>
</P>
<PRE>    commandPort -n ":2222";</PRE>
<P>
Press the enter key on the numerica keypad. This command tells Maya to<BR>
"listen" for connections on port "2222". There is no special significance<BR>
to using 2222 - it could be any number so long as it does not clash with<BR>
a reserved port number. Stay with 2222 and you will have no problems!<BR>
Make a note of the IP addess of the computer on which Maya is running<BR>
On the Windows operating system, open a command window and type,<BR>
</P>
<PRE>    ipconfig</PRE>
<P>
The IP address will be four numbers separated by periods, for example,<BR>
</P>
<PRE>    10.7.101.30</PRE>
<P>
You are now ready to begin a Cutter/Maya session. Either open an existing<BR>
mel script or open a new window. Press the button in the top right hand<BR>
corner of the window. Some network options will appear below the regular<BR>
text controls.
<BR>
<BR>
Select "Peer" from the popup menu. Enter the IP address that you previusly<BR>
made a note of into the IP text field. The "port" text field should already<BR>
dispay number "2222". Click on the selection box that appears immediately<BR>
to the right of the port text field. After a very brief pause a small "client<BR>
log" window will open. Maya will return messages to this window, though it<BR>
has to be said the messages are fairly uninformative!<BR>
<BR>
Cutter will warn you if a network connection cannot be established. To test<BR>
the connection type this command and either click the "send" button or press<BR>
control+e or alt+e ("e" for execute").

A nurbs sphere should appear in Maya's main window.
