With Houdini4.0 and above, there is a new high-performance expression 
language (VEX) which can be used in many places in the product.  Expression
evaluation is typically very efficient giving perfomance close to
compiled C/C++ code.  VEX was <b>not</b> designed as a replacement to
the existing Houdini Expression Language, but rather an smaller, more
efficient general purpose language.<p>

Because of its nature, VEX is only available in several select places
in the Houdini package.  These are currently:<p>
<menu>
    <li> <b>COPs</b> - The VEX Cop allows you to write complex custom
	    COPs without writing any C/C++ code.  The expressions
	    evaluate very close to C/C++ speeds and run 1000's of
	    times faster than the Pixel Expression COP.

    <li> <b>POPs</b> - The VEX Pop allows you to do almost anything
	    that POPs can do themselves.  It is possible to write one
	    single VEX function which performs the task of many POPs.
	    Because the VEX code is localized to one single operator,
	    the VEX code will typically run faster than a network of
	    POPs.

    <li> <b>SOPs</b> - VEX allows you to write any SOP which
	    manipulates point attributes.  This can move points
	    around, adjust velocities, change colors.  As well, you
	    can group points or do many other useful tasks.  VEX SOPs
	    typically run 10 or more times faster than a point SOP.

    <li> <b>CHOPs</b> - VEX allows you to custom CHOPs.  The CHOP
	    functions can manipulate arbitrary numbers of input
	    channels and process channel data in arbitrary ways.
	    In some cases, the VEX code can run faster that compiled
	    C++ code.

    <li> <b>Rendering</b> - The new renderer <b>vmantra</b> uses VEX
	    for all shading computation.  This includes light,
	    surface, displacement and atmosphere shaders.
